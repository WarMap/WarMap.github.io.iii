        <p>#UIView</p>
<p>In iOS, you use windows and views to present your application’s content on the screen. Windows do not have any visible content themselves but provide a basic container for your application’s views. Views define a portion of a window that you want to fill with some content. For example, you might have views that display images, text, shapes, or some combination thereof. You can also use views to organize and manage other views.</p>
<p>##View Architecture Fundamentals</p>
<p>Most of the things you might want to do visually are done with view objects—instances of the UIView class. A view object defines a rectangular region on the screen and handles the drawing and touch events in that region. A view can also act as a parent for other views and coordinate the placement and sizing of those views. The UIView class does most of the work in managing these relationships between views, but you can also customize the default behavior as needed.</p>
<p>Views work in conjunction with Core Animation layers to handle the rendering and animating of a view’s content. Every view in UIKit is backed by a layer object (usually an instance of the CALayer class), which manages the backing store for the view and handles view-related animations. Most operations you perform should be through the UIView interface. However, in situations where you need more control over the rendering or animation behavior of your view, you can perform operations through its layer instead.</p>
<p>To understand the relationship between views and layers, it helps to look at an example. Figure 1-1 shows the view architecture from the ViewTransitions sample application along with the relationship to the underlying Core Animation layers. The views in the application include a window (which is also a view), a generic UIView object that acts as a container view, an image view, a toolbar for displaying controls, and a bar button item (which is not a view itself but which manages a view internally). (The actual ViewTransitions sample application includes an additional image view that is used to implement transitions. For simplicity, and because that view is usually hidden, it is not included in Figure 1-1.) Every view has a corresponding layer object that can be accessed from that view’s layer property. (Because a bar button item is not a view, you cannot access its layer directly.) Behind those layer objects are Core Animation rendering objects and ultimately the hardware buffers used to manage the actual bits on the screen.</p>
<p>#####Figure 1-1  Architecture of the views in a sample application<br><img src="http://i4.tietuku.com/16cc3cc0b880e1c6.jpg" alt=""><br>The use of Core Animation layer objects has important implications for performance. The actual drawing code of a view object is called as little as possible, and when the code is called, the results are cached by Core Animation and reused as much as possible later. Reusing already-rendered content eliminates the expensive drawing cycle usually needed to update views. Reuse of this content is especially important during animations, where the existing content can be manipulated. Such reuse is much less expensive than creating new content.</p>
<p>##View Hierarchies and Subview Management<br>In addition to providing its own content, a view can act as a container for other views. When one view contains another, a parent-child relationship is created between the two views. The child view in the relationship is known as the subview and the parent view is known as the superview. The creation of this type of relationship has implications for both the visual appearance of your application and the application’s behavior.</p>
<p>Visually, the content of a subview obscures all or part of the content of its parent view. If the subview is totally opaque, then the area occupied by the subview completely obscures the corresponding area of the parent. If the subview is partially transparent, the content from the two views is blended together prior to being displayed on the screen. Each superview stores its subviews in an ordered array and the order in that array also affects the visibility of each subview. If two sibling subviews overlap each other, the one that was added last (or was moved to the end of the subview array) appears on top of the other.</p>
<p>The superview-subview relationship also impacts several view behaviors. Changing the size of a parent view has a ripple effect that can cause the size and position of any subviews to change too. When you change the size of a parent view, you can control the resizing behavior of each subview by configuring the view appropriately. Other changes that affect subviews include hiding a superview, changing a superview’s alpha (transparency), or applying a mathematical transform to a superview’s coordinate system.</p>
<p>The arrangement of views in a view hierarchy also determines how your application responds to events. When a touch occurs inside a specific view, the system sends an event object with the touch information directly to that view for handling. However, if the view does not handle a particular touch event, it can pass the event object along to its superview. If the superview does not handle the event, it passes the event object to its superview, and so on up the responder chain. Specific views can also pass the event object to an intervening responder object, such as a view controller. If no object handles the event, it eventually reaches the application object, which generally discards it.</p>
<p>##The View Drawing Cycle<br>The iOS native graphics system combines three major technologies: UIKit, Core Graphics, and Core Animation. UIKit provides views and some high-level drawing functionality within those views, Core Graphics provides additional (lower-level) drawing support within UIKit views, and Core Animation provides the ability to apply transformations and animation to UIKit views. Core Animation is also responsible for view compositing.</p>
<p>The UIView class uses an on-demand drawing model for presenting content. When a view first appears on the screen, the system asks it to draw its content. The system captures a snapshot of this content and uses that snapshot as the view’s visual representation. If you never change the view’s content, the view’s drawing code may never be called again. The snapshot image is reused for most operations involving the view. If you do change the content, you notify the system that the view has changed. The view then repeats the process of drawing the view and capturing a snapshot of the new results.</p>
<p>When the contents of your view change, you do not redraw those changes directly. Instead, you invalidate the view using either the setNeedsDisplay or setNeedsDisplayInRect: method. These methods tell the system that the contents of the view changed and need to be redrawn at the next opportunity. The system waits until the end of the current run loop before initiating any drawing operations. This delay gives you a chance to invalidate multiple views, add or remove views from your hierarchy, hide views, resize views, and reposition views all at once. All of the changes you make are then reflected at the same time.</p>
<p>Note: Changing a view’s geometry does not automatically cause the system to redraw the view’s content. The view’s contentMode property determines how changes to the view’s geometry are interpreted. Most content modes stretch or reposition the existing snapshot within the view’s boundaries and do not create a new one. For more information about how content modes affect the drawing cycle of your view, see Content Modes.<br>When the time comes to render your view’s content, the actual drawing process varies depending on the view and its configuration. System views typically implement private drawing methods to render their content. Those same system views often expose interfaces that you can use to configure the view’s actual appearance. For custom UIView subclasses, you typically override the drawRect: method of your view and use that method to draw your view’s content. There are also other ways to provide a view’s content, such as setting the contents of the underlying layer directly, but overriding the drawRect: method is the most common technique.</p>
<p>##The Runtime Interaction Model for Views<br>Any time a user interacts with your user interface, or any time your own code programmatically changes something, a complex sequence of events takes place inside of UIKit to handle that interaction. At specific points during that sequence, UIKit calls out to your view classes and gives them a chance to respond on behalf of your application. Understanding these callout points is important to understanding where your views fit into the system. Figure 1-7 shows the basic sequence of events that starts with the user touching the screen and ends with the graphics system updating the screen content in response. The same sequence of events would also occur for any programmatically initiated actions.</p>
<p>#####Figure 1-7  UIKit interactions with your view objects<br><img src="http://i4.tietuku.com/1d944b80f0d8bbd8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The following steps break the event sequence in Figure 1-7 down even further and explain what happens at each stage and how you might want your application to react in response.</p>
<ol>
<li>The user touches the screen.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The hardware reports the touch event to the UIKit framework.</li>
<li>The UIKit framework packages the touch into a UIEvent object and dispatches it to the appropriate view. (For a detailed explanation of how     UIKit delivers events to your views, see Event Handling Guide for iOS.)</li>
<li>The event-handling code of your view responds to the event. For example, your code might:<ul>
<li>Change the properties (frame, bounds, alpha, and so on) of the view or its subviews.</li>
<li>Call the setNeedsLayout method to mark the view (or its subviews) as needing a layout update.</li>
<li>Call the setNeedsDisplay or setNeedsDisplayInRect: method to mark the view (or its subviews) as needing to be redrawn.</li>
<li>Notify a controller about changes to some piece of data.<br>Of course, it is up to you to decide which of these things the view should do and which methods it should call.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If the geometry of a view changed for any reason, UIKit updates its subviews according to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have configured autoresizing rules for your views, UIKit adjusts each view according to those rules. For more information about how autoresizing rules work, see Handling Layout Changes Automatically Using Autoresizing Rules.</li>
<li><p>If the view implements the layoutSubviews method, UIKit calls it.</p>
<p>  You can override this method in your custom views and use it to adjust the position and size of any subviews. For example, a view that provides a large scrollable area would need to use several subviews as “tiles” rather than create one large view, which is not likely to fit in memory anyway. In its implementation of this method, the view would hide any subviews that are now offscreen or reposition them and use them to draw newly exposed content. As part of this process, the view’s layout code can also invalidate any views that need to be redrawn.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If any part of any view was marked as needing to be redrawn, UIKit asks the view to redraw itself.</p>
<p>  For custom views that explicitly define a drawRect: method, UIKit calls that method. Your implementation of this method should redraw the specified area of the view as quickly as possible and nothing else. Do not make additional layout changes at this point and do not make other changes to your application’s data model. The purpose of this method is to update the visual content of your view.</p>
<p>  Standard system views typically do not implement a drawRect: method but instead manage their drawing at this time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any updated views are composited with the rest of the application’s visible content and sent to the graphics hardware for display.</p>
</li>
<li>The graphics hardware transfers the rendered content to the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because view objects are the main way your application interacts with the user, they have a number of responsibilities. Here are just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drawing and animation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Views draw content in their rectangular area using technologies such as UIKit, Core Graphics, and OpenGL ES.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some view properties can be animated to new values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Layout and subview management</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A view may contain zero or more subviews.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each view defines its own default resizing behavior in relation to its parent view.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A view can define the size and position of its subviews as needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Event handling</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A view is a responder and can handle touch events and other events defined by the UIResponder class.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Views can use the addGestureRecognizer: method to install gesture recognizers to handle common gestures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><code>Block objects are a C-level syntactic and runtime feature. They are similar to standard C functions, but in addition to executable code they may also contain variable bindings to automatic (stack) or managed (heap) memory. A block can therefore maintain a set of state (data) that it can use to impact behavior when executed.</code><br>Block 是C语言级的语法并有运行时特性。它和C语言的标准函数很相似，但是在有可执行的代码基础上它还有可能将变量保存到栈或者堆上。因此Block持有了一组“状态值”来确保执行的结果</p>
<p><code>You can use blocks to compose function expressions that can be passed to API, optionally stored, and used by multiple threads. Blocks are particularly useful as a callback because the block carries both the code to be executed on callback and the data needed during that execution.</code><br>你可以用blocks来组织一段具有某种功能的代码段，而且可以传递给API、选择性存储、多线程使用。Blocks作为回调尤其的好使，因为block携带了回调需要执行的代码和执行时所需的数据（参数）。</p>
<h3 id="Block_Functionality"><a href="#Block_Functionality" class="headerlink" title="Block Functionality"></a>Block Functionality</h3><ul>
<li>Has a typed argument list just like a function</li>
<li>像函数一样有一个参数列表</li>
<li>Has an inferred or declared return type</li>
<li>有一个返回值类型</li>
<li>Can capture state from the lexical scope within which it is defined</li>
<li>能抓到它定义所在的词法作用域中的state</li>
<li>Can optionally modify the state of the lexical scope</li>
<li>能在词法作用域内选择性的修改state</li>
<li>Can share the potential for modification with other blocks defined within the same lexical scope</li>
<li></li>
<li>Can continue to share and modify state defined within the lexical scope (the stack frame) after the lexical scope (the stack frame) has been destroyed</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Usage"><a href="#Usage" class="headerlink" title="Usage"></a>Usage</h3><p>Blocks represent typically small, self-contained pieces of code. As such, they’re particularly useful as a means of encapsulating units of work that may be executed concurrently, or over items in a collection, or as a callback when another operation has finished.<br>Blocks 是典型的麻雀虽小，五脏俱全的小代码块，例如，它尤其适用于在并发执行一段代码，遍历集合元素，操作完成的回调<br>Blocks are a useful alternative to traditional callback functions for two main reasons:<br>Blocks 出于以下两点原因非常适用于回调：</p>
<ul>
<li>They allow you to write code at the point of invocation that is executed later in the context of the method implementation.<br>Blocks are thus often parameters of framework methods.</li>
<li><p>调用函数时就可以书写函数执行完之后要执行的代码</p>
</li>
<li><p>They allow access to local variables.<br>Rather than using callbacks requiring a data structure that embodies all the contextual information you need to perform an operation, you simply access local variables directly.</p>
</li>
<li>能访问本地变量</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Getting_Started_with_Blocks"><a href="#Getting_Started_with_Blocks" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started with Blocks"></a>Getting Started with Blocks</h1><h3 id="Declaring_and_Using_a_Block"><a href="#Declaring_and_Using_a_Block" class="headerlink" title="Declaring and Using a Block"></a>Declaring and Using a Block</h3><p>You use the <strong>^</strong> operator to declare a block variable and to indicate the beginning of a block literal. The body of the block itself is contained within {}, as shown in this example (as usual with C, ; indicates the end of the statement):<br><img src="http://ww4.sinaimg.cn/large/77178728gw1ezbonewlmxj20fg06cmy4.jpg" alt=""><br>Notice that the block is able to make use of variables from the same scope in which it was defined.<br><strong>注意</strong>：block能使用在其被定义的scope内的变量</p>
<p>If you declare a block as a variable, you can then use it just as you would a function:<br>如果你声明block为一个变量，你可以像调用一个函数一样调用它</p>
<pre><code>int multiplier = 7;
int (^myBlock)(int) = ^(int num) {
    return num * multiplier;
};
printf(&quot;%d&quot;, myBlock(3));
// prints &quot;21&quot;`
</code></pre><h3 id="Using_a_Block_Directly"><a href="#Using_a_Block_Directly" class="headerlink" title="Using a Block Directly"></a>Using a Block Directly</h3><p>In many cases, you don’t need to declare block variables; instead you simply write a block literal inline where it’s required as an argument. The following example uses the qsort_b function. qsort_b is similar to the standard qsort_r function, but takes a block as its final argument.<br>在很多情况下啊，你并不需要声明一个block变量。而是当一个参数，这时只需写出block的实现即可。下面给出例子，qsort_b函数，和qsort_r函数相似，但是需要block作为最后一个参数</p>
<pre><code>char *myCharacters[3] = { &quot;TomJohn&quot;, &quot;George&quot;, &quot;Charles Condomine&quot; };

qsort_b(myCharacters, 3, sizeof(char *), ^(const void *l, const void *r) {
    char *left = *(char **)l;
     char *right = *(char **)r;
     return strncmp(left, right, 1);
});

// myCharacters is now { &quot;Charles Condomine&quot;, &quot;George&quot;, &quot;TomJohn&quot; }
</code></pre><h3 id="Blocks_with_Cocoa"><a href="#Blocks_with_Cocoa" class="headerlink" title="Blocks with Cocoa"></a>Blocks with Cocoa</h3><p>Several methods in the Cocoa frameworks take a block as an argument, typically either to perform an operation on a collection of objects, or to use as a callback after an operation has finished. The following example shows how to use a block with the NSArray method sortedArrayUsingComparator:. The method takes a single argument—the block. For illustration, in this case the block is defined as an NSComparator local variable:<br>有一些Cocoa frameworks的方法接收block做一个参数，典型的应用如：在集合中元素的操作或一个操作完成后的回调。下面的例子展示了NSArray的方法sortedArrayUsingComparator:中如何使用的block。这个方法接收了一个单参数的block。说明一下，这里block定义为一个NSComparator类型的本地变量</p>
<pre><code>NSArray *stringsArray = @[ @&quot;string 1&quot;,
                           @&quot;String 21&quot;,
                           @&quot;string 12&quot;,
                           @&quot;String 11&quot;,
                           @&quot;String 02&quot; ];
static NSStringCompareOptions comparisonOptions = NSCaseInsensitiveSearch | NSNumericSearch | NSWidthInsensitiveSearch | NSForcedOrderingSearch;
NSLocale *currentLocale = [NSLocale currentLocale];

NSComparator finderSortBlock = ^(id string1, id string2) {

NSRange string1Range = NSMakeRange(0, [string1 length]);
return [string1 compare:string2 options:comparisonOptions range:string1Range locale:currentLocale];
};

NSArray *finderSortArray = [stringsArray sortedArrayUsingComparator:finderSortBlock];
NSLog(@&quot;finderSortArray: %@&quot;, finderSortArray);

/*
Output:
finderSortArray: (
    &quot;string 1&quot;,
    &quot;String 02&quot;,
    &quot;String 11&quot;,
    &quot;string 12&quot;,
    &quot;String 21&quot;
)
*/
</code></pre><h3 id="block_Variables"><a href="#block_Variables" class="headerlink" title="__block Variables"></a>__block Variables</h3><p>A powerful feature of blocks is that they can modify variables in the same lexical scope. You signal that a block can modify a variable using the __block storage type modifier. Adapting the example shown in Blocks with Cocoa, you could use a block variable to count how many strings are compared as equal as shown in the following example. For illustration, in this case the block is used directly and uses currentLocale as a read-only variable within the block:</p>
<p>blocks有一个强大的特性，它能修改在同一词法范围内的变量值。block可以修改通过__block存储类型修饰符修饰的变量。改动一下上面的🌰，你可以使用一个block变量来统计下面这个🌰中有多字符串是相同的。说明一下，这里是直接使用的block并在block中用了currentLocale变量（只读）。</p>
<pre><code>NSArray *stringsArray = @[ @&quot;string 1&quot;,
                           @&quot;String 21&quot;, // &lt;-
                           @&quot;string 12&quot;,
                           @&quot;String 11&quot;,
                           @&quot;Strîng 21&quot;, // &lt;-
                           @&quot;Striñg 21&quot;, // &lt;-
                           @&quot;String 02&quot; ];

NSLocale *currentLocale = [NSLocale currentLocale];
__block NSUInteger orderedSameCount = 0;

NSArray *diacriticInsensitiveSortArray = [stringsArray sortedArrayUsingComparator:^(id string1, id string2) {

    NSRange string1Range = NSMakeRange(0, [string1 length]);
    NSComparisonResult comparisonResult = [string1 compare:string2 options:NSDiacriticInsensitiveSearch range:string1Range locale:currentLocale];

    if (comparisonResult == NSOrderedSame) {
        orderedSameCount++;
    }
    return comparisonResult;
}];

NSLog(@&quot;diacriticInsensitiveSortArray: %@&quot;, diacriticInsensitiveSortArray);
NSLog(@&quot;orderedSameCount: %d&quot;, orderedSameCount);

/*

<pre><code>void NSLog ( NSString *format, ... );

- (instancetype)initWithFormat:(NSString *)format, ...

- (instancetype)initWithTitle:(NSString *)title
                 delegate:(id&lt;UIActionSheetDelegate&gt;)delegate
        cancelButtonTitle:(NSString *)cancelButtonTitle
   destructiveButtonTitle:(NSString *)destructiveButtonTitle
        otherButtonTitles:(NSString *)otherButtonTitles, ...
</code></pre><p>不定参数函数的参数数量是可变动的，它使用省略号来忽略之后的参数。需要注意的是:<strong>不定参数函数最少要有一个命名的参数</strong>,不然你就会收到如下错误提示,但在C++，则没有这种强制要求。 （虽然在C++中，这样的声明是合理的，但是这种写法，因为没有已命名的参数，使得va_start没办法抓到动态参数的正确起始点。）</p>

<p>##剖析<br>原型： void va_start(va_list arg_ptr,prev_param)<br>功能： prev_param为最后一个固定参数，<strong>函数参数列表中参数在内存中的顺序与函数声明时的顺序是一致的。</strong>这里对应的就是参数food2.va_start根据prev_param的地址起点来确定不定参数的内存起始地址，然后赋值给arg_ptr。</p>
<p>原型：type va_arg(va_list arg_ptr,type);<br>功能：获取下一个变参的地址。arg_ptr即为当前要取出变参的地址，type为要取出变参的类型（决定返回值的类型）得到这个变参后，将arg_ptr指向下一个变参</p>
<p>原型：void  va_end(va_list arg_ptr);<br>功能：将va_list指针释放</p>
